# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech Converter

A simple and interactive browser-based **Text-to-Speech Converter** that allows users to enter text and hear it spoken aloud using the **Web Speech API**. This project was developed to explore DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with browser-native APIs using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



 📌 Project Purpose

The goal of this project was to build a lightweight, responsive web application that helps users convert any typed text into audible speech. This not only supports accessibility but also demonstrates how modern web APIs can be used to enhance user interaction in web development.

 ✅ Features

- 🎤 Converts text to speech using the Web Speech API  
- 🖱️ Responsive and user-friendly UI  
- 🚫 Input validation with error feedback  
- 🎨 Styled using CSS Flexbox and custom hover effects  
- 🧠 Fully built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **CSS** – Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** – Logic and DOM manipulation  
- **Web Speech API** – SpeechSynthesis for voice playback


👨‍💻 How It Works

1. User enters text into the textarea.
2. Clicks the **Play Converted Sound** button.
3. The browser speaks the entered text out loud.
4. If the textarea is empty, an error message is shown to prompt the user to enter text.



📈 Outcomes

This project helped reinforce the following skills:
- ✅ DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- ✅ Event handling (button clicks)
- ✅ Using browser APIs (`speechSynthesis`)
- ✅ Validating user input and giving visual feedback
- ✅ Designing accessible, interactive web interfaces
